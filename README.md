# Zachary Jones' React Final Project

## Application Purpose

This application addresses a factor of online-game economies that makes the experience worse: having to actually meet with and trade items to other people. All the inefficiencies of face-to-face communication with none of the urgency or politeness.

Now with this mindblowing new technology, you can engage in faux-online trading with none of the negative side effects including but not limited to: increased blood pressure, sudden awareness of the passage of time.

## How to run locally

1. Firstly, you will need to install the node dependencies with `npm install`
2. Secondly, you will need to start the json-server portion of the application. I included a shortcut for your convenience: enter `npm run start-json` in a terminal.
3. Thirdly, you will need to start the react application itself in a secondary terminal. This is done by entering the command `npm start`.

With those steps completed, the application will launch in your web browser and you can begin selecting trades to complete.

Your first step will need to be choosing "FIND TRADES" under the chaos orb. After that, you can pick from among the displayed trade options.

Once you have currency of other types, you can pick those to FIND TRADES for and exchange for other forms of currency.
